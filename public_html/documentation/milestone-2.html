<strong> Content Strategy:</strong> My PWP will be a personal portfolio that will consist of one page, and split into a
few different sections.
<p>
    The first section will be the <strong>Welcome</strong> area. This will include my name, and my job description of
    "Full Stack Web Developer" overlaid across a piece of my photography.
</p>
<p>
    The secondary section will be the <strong>About Me</strong> section. Here, I want to include some of my
    accomplishments, some of my skills, and past job history. Within this, I'd like to show off some of my talents and
    experiences that I can bring to a workplace environment and make sure employers are aware of my strengths.
