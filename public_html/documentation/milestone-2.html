<strong> Content Strategy:</strong> My PWP will be a personal portfolio that will consist of one page, and split into a
few different sections. I'd also like to provide a good color palette for the site, to make sure everything looks
synchronized, including any images.
<p>
    The first section will be the <strong>Welcome</strong> area. This will include my name, and my job description of
    "Full Stack Web Developer" overlaid across a piece of my photography.
</p>
<p>
    The secondary section will be the <strong>About Me</strong> section. Here, I want to include some of my
    accomplishments, some of my skills, and past job history. Within this, I'd like to show off some of my talents and
    experiences that I can bring to a workplace environment and make sure employers are aware of my strengths. I'd also
    like to include a portrait of myself here.
</p>
<p>
    The third section will consist of the <strong>Portfolio</strong> of my work. In this area, I want to provide a
    carousel of the projects I've worked on, and what I did within this projects. I'd probably like to include 3-4
    examples of things that I consider to be my most exemplary work.
</p>
<p>
    The fourth section will include the <strong>Contact Me</strong> form. Here, I'll allow employers to contact me via
    email, and include a message. I'll also include some brief info on a response time to the right as well, and some
    links to some other places you can see my projects and social media.
