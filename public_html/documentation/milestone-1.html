<p>
    <strong>Purpose:</strong> My purpose in building this PWP is to have something that a potential employer can look at
    and see the creativity I want to bring to web design,
    and the abilities I have to assist them. I also want to show-case some of my photography work as the backgrounds for
    a few part of the page, to show employers one of my hobbies.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Audience:</strong> The audience for my PWP will primarily consist of potential employers, and I want to
    design something that is both unique as well as intuitive to show
    my skills from what I've learned from the Full Stack boot-camp. I hope to continue to update this as a working
    resume for the near future, to showcase other things I've continued
    working on.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Goal:</strong> With this PWP, I am hoping to meet the goal of attaining full time employment, either as a
    junior Dev or an Intern, post boot-camp.
